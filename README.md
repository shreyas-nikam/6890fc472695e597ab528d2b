# Streamlit Data Explorer and Visualizer

## Project Title and Description

This Streamlit application, "Data Explorer and Visualizer," provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing data from various sources.  It allows users to upload CSV, Excel, or JSON files, or connect to common data sources such as Google Sheets.  Once data is loaded, users can perform various data transformations, explore data summaries, and create interactive visualizations to gain insights.  The application aims to simplify the process of data exploration and analysis for both technical and non-technical users.

## Features

*   **Data Loading:**
    *   Upload data from CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and JSON files.
    *   Connect to Google Sheets using a shareable link.
*   **Data Display:**
    *   Displays the data in an interactive table.
    *   Provides options to display basic statistics.
*   **Data Transformation:**
    *   Column selection and renaming.
    *   Basic filtering (equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than).
    *   Data type conversion (e.g., string to numeric, date to string).
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   Interactive plots using Plotly Express:
        *   Scatter plots
        *   Line charts
        *   Bar charts
        *   Histograms
        *   Box plots
        *   Pie charts
    *   Customizable plot parameters (e.g., X-axis, Y-axis, color, size).
*   **Data Download:**
    *   Download the transformed and cleaned data as a CSV file.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Intuitive layout and controls for easy navigation.
    *   Clear error messages and helpful hints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:**  Version 3.7 or higher is required.
*   **Pip:**  Python package installer.  Most Python installations come with pip.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following dependencies:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly-express
    openpyxl  # Required for reading excel files
    gspread  # Required for connecting to Google Sheets (optional, install if you use this feature)
    oauth2client  # Required for gspread (optional, install if you use this feature)
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    (Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your main Streamlit script.)

2.  **Access the application in your browser:**

    Streamlit will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can access it by navigating to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Using the application:**

    *   **Data Loading:** Select a data source (CSV, Excel, JSON, or Google Sheets) using the sidebar. Upload a file or provide a Google Sheets link.
    *   **Data Display:** The loaded data will be displayed in a table. You can choose to display statistics using the provided checkbox.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Use the provided sidebar widgets to select columns, rename them, filter data, and change data types.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Select the type of plot you want to create, and then choose the appropriate columns for the X-axis, Y-axis, color, and size.
    *   **Data Download:** Click the "Download Data as CSV" button to download the transformed data.
